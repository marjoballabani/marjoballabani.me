# marjoballabani.me

A neo-brutalist personal portfolio built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, no build tools, no dependencies - just raw code with bold design choices.

This is a personal fun project, not a production template. The code prioritizes creativity and experimentation over best practices. It's a playground for trying out ideas, animations, and interactions - not a reference architecture.

## What is Neo-Brutalism?

Neo-brutalism (also called neo-brutalist web design) is a UI style inspired by brutalist architecture - raw, bold, and unapologetically loud. It rejects the polished, rounded, drop-shadowed sameness of modern web design and replaces it with:

- **Thick black borders** - every element has a hard, visible edge
- **Flat, offset box shadows** - no soft gradients or blurs, just solid color blocks shifted by a few pixels (`box-shadow: 8px 8px 0 #000`)
- **High-contrast color palettes** - bright yellows, pinks, cyans, and greens on white/dark backgrounds
- **Visible structure** - the "bones" of the layout are intentionally exposed, not hidden behind smooth transitions
- **Playful imperfection** - torn paper edges, tape stickers, hand-drawn vibes mixed with geometric precision

This site leans into a **hand-crafted, scrapbook-like** take on neo-brutalism: paper tear dividers, a falling SVG terminal icon, highlight markers that animate on scroll, and a treasure map hidden behind a book-flip animation.

## Design Decisions

### Color System

The palette uses CSS custom properties for light/dark theming:

| Color | Variable | Usage |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Yellow | `--yellow` | Primary accent, CTAs, loader |
| Cyan | `--cyan` | Code elements, highlights |
| Pink | `--pink` | Secondary accent, highlights |
| Green | `--green` | Success states, highlights |
| Black | `--border` | Borders, shadows, text |

### Typography

- **Space Grotesk** - headings and body text (geometric sans-serif that fits the brutalist aesthetic)
- **Space Mono** - code snippets and terminal elements
- **Caveat** - handwritten annotations (the "human touch" element)

### Key Design Elements

**Paper Tear Effect** - Sections are separated by SVG-drawn torn paper edges that close on scroll with a parallax effect, finished by a tape sticker that "seals" the tear back together.

**Book Flip Timeline** - The journey section starts as a closed treasure map that flips open like a book page to reveal the career timeline underneath.

**Scroll-Driven Highlights** - Text highlights animate in from left/right as you scroll, mimicking a highlighter pen being drawn across the page.

**Interactive Map** - Leaflet.js with Stamen watercolor tiles, styled with a grid overlay and pirate illustration. Clicking timeline entries flies to the corresponding map marker.

**Matrix Typing Effect** - The hero greeting scrambles through random characters before resolving to the final text.

**Falling Decorative Icons** - SVG icons around the hero photo drop with gravity when you start scrolling.
